                    <br>My research centers around language model alignment; enforcing safety without hampering its cognitive 
                    abilities. I often draw inspiration from biological intelligences to aid im my work with artificial ones. 
                    I enjoy learning about how the mind works and the cognitive principles that can be applied to it.`,

                    part of a program through RPI.  During this time, I researched new techniques of model alignment using text-based
                    game for safety training on moral and ethical principles.<hr>

                    assistant.  In this position, I hold office hours, aid the professor in grading, and help students
                    to better grasp relevant course material.<hr>

                    During the Summer of 2022, I had worked for SUNY New Paltz through their summer undergraduate research experience, details
                    about this can be found in the <u style="cursor: pointer" onClick="window.showPage('chipFiring')">Chip Firing page</u> and
                    in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10327" target="_blank">arXiv submission</a> for the resulting paper.
                    With this job, I worked closely with my professor to gain research experience and to develop research for later publishing.<hr>

                    I am also currently employed at Cyber Guardian Consulting Group.  Here, I have developed a variety of proprietary business
                    solutions using a variety of languages and web services, primarily AWS.  Further details of these projects
