                    <br><br>I have worked on numerous different academic and research projects.  In many of these, I was the primary organizer of the project
                    and in charge of delegating tasks to collaborators or teammates.  This is evident in my projects like 
                    <a href="/research/predictChain">Predict Chain</a>, <a href="/hackathons/anonHires">Anonymous Hiring</a>, or my Master's thesis,
