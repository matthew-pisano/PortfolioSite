                vertex on the graph is assigned a positive or negative integer, representing the 
                number of 'chips' that vertex has.  Each vertex has two moves, borrowing and lending.
                When a vertex borrows, all of its neighboring vertices transfer one 'chip' to the 
                borrowing vertex.  Lending is the opposite, where the lending vertex donates one 
                'chip' to all neighboring vertices.  For directed graphs, each vertex can only lend 
                or borrow from the vertices connected to it by its <i>outgoing</i> edges only.
                The aim of the game is to find some series of lending and borrowing moves such that 
                every vertex has zero or more 'chips'.</>,

                given divisor will result in a divisor that has had those specific lending or 
                borrowing moves preformed on it.  Through use of the laplacian, both the picard group 
                and jacobian can be calculated.  As the nature of a graph changes through changing 
                the number of vertices, making edges directed or undirected, the valid solutions to 
                a game can change greatly.</>

                cycle graphs, pseudotrees, and wheel graphs.  Our goal is to be able to make generalized 
                predictions of the structure of a Picard group of an arbitrary graph, given that it 
                falls into one of these classes. We aim to prove our conjectures through a mix of 
                logical proofs and experimentation for some or all of the graphs in one of these 
                classes.  Experimentation is done using Python and the NumPy library to calculate 
                the Picard group of any given graphs and to analyze any patterns that arise from

                fact that a tree graph only has one spanning tree.

                The rank of a tree's Picard group is more complex, but still follows a clear pattern.  
                The rank is determined by the number of terminal-strong-components inside that tree.
                These components are areas of the tree that are strongly connected, but only have 
                edges pointing inward to them from the greater tree.  The greater the number of these

                are more complex.  The Jacobian of a cycle graph depends on the number of paths that 
                it has.  A path, in this case, is a region of the graph where all edges are either 
                oriented in one direction or are bidirectional.  For zero paths (all edges are bidirectional), 
                the Jacobian is <Latex>{`$\\mathbb{Z}_n$`}</Latex> and for one path, it is always trivial.  For two
                paths, the Jacobian is more complex, but also well-defined.  The Jacobian
                is <Latex>{`$\\mathbb{Z}_{x-2}$`}</Latex>, where <Latex>{`$x$`}</Latex> is the number
                of bidirectional paths counter-clockwise from the clockwise path and clockwise
                from the counter-clockwise path with no yet noted exceptions.  For all other
                numbers of paths, we have not yet discovered a complete description as we have with
                two paths.  However, we have noticed that there is also always a single invariant
                factor and this invariant factor is almost always <Latex>{`$\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\dots \\mathbb{Z}_4$`}</Latex> for
                sizes of graphs smaller than size fifteen.  We suspect that, for very large graphs,
                the behavior of four or more paths approaches that of two paths.

                graphs can be split into four broad categories when the 'rim' of the wheel is always 
                directed a single way and when the 'spokes' are also directed a single way.  Notably, 
                when all the edges of a graph are bidirectional, an interesting patter emerges between 
                the Jacobians of wheels of different sizes.  The Jacobian of a wheel graph of size <Latex>{`$n$`}</Latex> is
