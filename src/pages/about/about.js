                game for safety training on moral and ethical principles.  More information can be found in the 
                <a href="/research/highGround">Moral High Ground</a> page<hr>
                
                Through my employment at Cyber Guardian Consulting Group, I have developed a variety of proprietary business

                web applications.<hr>
                
                Over the past three semesters, I have been employed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as a teaching
                assistant.  In this position, I hold office hours, aid the professor in grading, and help students
                to better grasp relevant course material.<hr>

                During the Summer of 2022, I had worked for SUNY New Paltz through their summer undergraduate research experience, details

                <br><br>I have worked on numerous different academic and research projects.  In many of these, I was the primary organizer of the project
                and in charge of delegating tasks to collaborators or teammates.  This is evident in my projects like 
                <a href="/research/predictChain">Predict Chain</a>, <a href="/hackathons/anonHires">Anonymous Hiring</a>, or my Master's thesis,

                on my community's local recreation center.  My experience has continued on from there as I took active roles in
                the planning and machine learning components of PredictChain, the front-end and ChatGPT interface of Mathesis,
                leading the front-end development of the <a href="/hackathons/anonHires">Anonymous Hires</a>
