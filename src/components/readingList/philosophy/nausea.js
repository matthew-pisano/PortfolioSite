                    The message of <i>Nausea</i> is conveyed through a series of journal entries by the text's
                    protagonist. Antoine Roquentin is a historian working in the fictional town of Bouville, France. At
                    the outset, Roquentin informs the reader that he started his journal to help explain the strange
                    feelings that he has been experiencing. He describes this feeling as a <i>Nausea</i>, an
                    overwhelming feeling somewhere between dead and emptiness. He feels it permeate not only himself,
                    but also the world around him: a stone, a tree root, the wet pieces of paper he likes to pick up
                    from the street. All are permeated with a sickening feeling that they are not quite real, that ...
                    he is not quite real. These bouts of the <i>Nausea</i> come and go throughout his time journaling as
                    he questions what he is doing, why is he here, and why anything exists at all.
                    <p>
                        For the last ten years, Roquentin has been working on a biography of the Marquis de Rollebon, a
                        Bouville aristocrat who lived during the late eighteenth century. As bouts of the <i>Nausea</i>{" "}
                        become more frequent, Roquentin dedicates more and more of his time toward his research on the
                        Marquis. Writing from the early 1930s, Roquentin must take frequent trips to libraries and
                        archives to track down the sparse information that remains. Another frequent guest of the local
                        library is someone that Roquentin calls the "Self-Taught Man"
                        <FootRef idx={1} />. Roquentin notes that the Self-Taught Man spends the majority of his free
                        time in the library, reading every single book in alphabetical order by author. During one of
                        their conversations, the man asks Roquentin to show him some pictures of his travels. Before
                        coming to Bouville, the journal's author had spent several years travelling the world
                        extensively in search of adventure. The Self-Taught Man is amazed and inspired by the images and
                        the stories of, what he considers to be, Roquentin's past adventures. Thinking back, however,
                        Roquentin does not believe he has had any true adventures at all, even after six years of
                        travel. This occurs on the backdrop of his growing frustrations with his work on the Marquis de
                        Rollebon.

                        Roquentin soon gets a letter from Anny, his ex-lover whom he has not seen since he bagan his
                        travels. She excitedly invited him to visit her in Paris in a few weeks. An actress, Roquentin
                        recalls that she was often frustrated with him for not knowing exactly what to say or do, as if
                        he was failing to play his part in a production. At first, Roquentin was not very eager to
                        reunite, but as his feelings of <i>Nausea</i> grew stronger, it soon became his only short-term
                        focus. Overwhelmed with a sense of futility, he gives up on the biography that he has sent a
                        decade on so far. What was the point of writing about a dead man from a dead time that had
                        slowly consumed his life? He felt as if that book had become the only justification for his own
                        existence. If he did not exist to do his research, why did he exist at all?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, the Self-Taught Man invited Roquentin to lunch at a local cafe that they often
                        frequented. Based on his observations, the man believes that Roquentin is a humanist and
                        socialist, just as he is. Though he is sparse in details, the Self-Taught Man reveals that he
                        had fallen in love with humanity after his time as a German POW during the first world war.
                        Convinced that the two men think alike, he tries to get Roquentin to admit to being a humanist
                        himself. Under this pressure, Roquentin criticises him for what he thinks are naive beliefs: the
                        Self-Taught Man only loves the labels he assigns to people, rather than the complex nature of
                        each person themselves. He argues that claiming to love someone only after stripping them down
                        to their essence is meaningless as that ideal person does not exist. Consumed once again by a
                        wave of the <i>Nausea</i>, Roquentin abruptly gets up, holding a knife which he contemplates
                        turning upon his lunch guest. However, his mind is grounded by the feeling of the knife's handle
                        in his hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roquentin realized what his <i>Nausea</i> actually is: the fear of his own existence. The knife
                        handle, the table, the patrons, the cafe, they all loose their essence: the merely exist.
                        Escaping to the park, he sits on a bench with his foot next to the root of a chessnut tree. As
                        he sits these, he contemplates the root. He cannot find the words to describe it, it also merely
                        exists, independent of any description or label. When he tries to describe the root, he is no
                        longer speaking of the root itself, but of abstract concepts that he assigns to it. There is no
                        reason for the root, or anything else to exist, to emerge from nothingness. Roquentin thinks
                        that it is wholly random and without reason. People describe and assign categories to things in
                        an attempt to justify the existence of those things, but those things exist independently of any
                        classification. Roquentin realizes that his <i>Nausea</i> is from his attempts to assign meaning
                        to the meaningless.

                        Roquentin only moved to Bouville to enable his research on the Marquis de Rollebon. Now that he
                        no longer sees the purpose of that research, he has no reason to remain in town. After seeing
                        Anny, he plans to pack up his belongings, settle his debts, and move to Paris. As he sets off to
                        see Anny, he hopes that he can explain the <i>Nausea</i> to her ad find commonality in it. When
                        he arrives at her hotel room, he finds it different than expected. He always knew Anny to
                        decorate even short stays with art pieces and artifacts from around the world that she had
                        packed. However, the room is nearly bare. Anny herself looked different, she had aged, gained
                        weight, and she no longer had some of the vigour that he had known her to have. Anny is pleased
                        to see him, but not for his company, she is still frustrated at his awkward conversation. She is
                        pleased because she believes that Roquentin is a static person: he never changes, a milestone.
                        She can always measure how much she has changed by using him as a reference. She called him here
                        to get a sense of hos much she has changed over the past siz years and to explain that to him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roquentin disagrees with her assessment, especially due to his recent revelations on the nature
                        of his <i>Nausea</i>. He tries to explain, but she interrupts him. Her memory is precise and she
                        is able to recall exact moments in the past when Roquentin failed to do or say the right thing.
                        She explains her concept of "privileged situations" to him, specific scenes that have been
                        preordained to happen, like reference images in an old history book that was taken from her as a
                        child. In her mind, these situations must be turned into "perfect moments" by acting them out
                        just as they appear in her idealized world. This is why she was often frustrated with Roquentin,
                        but unable to explain why. He always said or did the wrong thing, ruining these potential
                        moments. This was also the reasoning for her starting, and later quitting acting. She was unable
                        to always control the realization of her ideal scenes. Roquentin is excited to hear this,
                        thinking that Anny has independently come to the same conclusion about <i>Nausea</i> as he had.
                        He describes his ideas about existence being independent form essence, but Anny disagrees. To
                        her, the existence of a moment in time is tied closely to its essence in her mind. She asks him
                        to leave.
