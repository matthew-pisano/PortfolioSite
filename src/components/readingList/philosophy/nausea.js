                <>
                    The message of <i>Nausea</i> is conveyed through a series of journal entries by the text's
                    protagonist. Antoine Roquentin is a historian working in the fictional town of Bouville, France. At
                    the outset, Roquentin informs the reader that he started his journal to help explain the strange
                    feelings that he has been experiencing. He describes this feeling as a <i>Nausea</i>, an
                    overwhelming feeling somewhere between dread and emptiness. He feels it permeate not only himself,
                    but also the world around him: a stone, a tree root, the wet pieces of paper he likes to pick up
                    from the street. All are permeated with a sickening feeling that they are not quite real, that ...
                    he is not quite real. These bouts of the <i>Nausea</i> come and go throughout his time journaling as
                    he questions what he is doing, why is he here, and why anything exists at all.
                    <p>
                        For the last ten years, Roquentin has been working on a biography of the Marquis de Rollebon, a
                        Bouville aristocrat who lived during the late eighteenth century. As bouts of the <i>Nausea</i>{" "}
                        become more frequent, Roquentin dedicates more and more of his time toward his research on the
                        Marquis. Writing from the early 1930s, Roquentin must take frequent trips to libraries and
                        archives to track down the sparse information that remains of the Marquis. Another frequent
                        guest of the local library is someone that Roquentin calls the "Self-Taught Man"
                        <FootRef idx={1} />. Roquentin notes that the Self-Taught Man spends the majority of his free
                        time in the library, reading every single book in alphabetical order by author. During one of
                        their conversations, the man asks Roquentin to show him some pictures of his travels. Before
                        coming to Bouville, the journal's author had spent several years travelling the world
                        extensively in search of adventure. The Self-Taught Man is amazed and inspired by the images and
                        the stories of, what he considers to be, Roquentin's past adventures. Thinking back, however,
                        Roquentin does not believe he has had any true adventures at all, even after six years of
                        travel. This occurs on the backdrop of his growing frustrations with his work on the Marquis de
                        Rollebon.

                    <p>
                        Roquentin soon gets a letter from Anny, his ex-lover whom he has not seen since he began his
                        travels. She excitedly invites him to visit her in Paris in a few weeks. An actress, Roquentin
                        recalls that she was often frustrated with him for not knowing exactly what to say or do, as if
                        he was failing to play his part in a production. At first, Roquentin was not very eager to
                        reunite, but as his feelings of <i>Nausea</i> grew stronger, the trip soon became his only
                        short-term focus. Overwhelmed with a sense of futility, he gives up on the biography that he has
                        sent a decade on so far. What was the point of writing about a dead man from a dead time that
                        had slowly consumed his life? He felt as if that book had become the only justification for his
                        own existence. If he did not exist to do his research, why did he exist at all?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, the Self-Taught Man invites Roquentin to lunch at a local cafe that they often frequent.
                        Based on his observations, the man believes that Roquentin is a humanist and socialist, just as
                        he is. Though he is sparse in details, the Self-Taught Man reveals that he had fallen in love
                        with humanity after his time as a German POW during the first world war. Convinced that the two
                        men think alike, he tries to get Roquentin to admit to being a humanist himself. Under this
                        pressure, Roquentin criticises him for what he thinks are naive beliefs: the Self-Taught Man
                        only loves the labels he assigns to people, rather than the complex nature of each person
                        themselves. He argues that claiming to love someone only after stripping them down to their
                        essence is meaningless: that ideal person does not exist. Consumed once again by a wave of the{" "}
                        <i>Nausea</i>, Roquentin abruptly gets up, holding a knife which he, in his haze, privately
                        contemplates turning upon his lunch guest. However, his mind is grounded by the feeling of the
                        knife's handle in his hand and he decides to leave without incident.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roquentin realized what his <i>Nausea</i> actually is: the fear of his own existence. The knife
                        handle, the table, the patrons, the cafe, they all loose their essence: the merely exist.
                        Escaping to the park, he sits on a bench with his foot next to the root of a chessnut tree. As
                        he sits these, he contemplates the root. He cannot find the words to describe it. It also merely
                        exists, independent of any description or label. When he tries to describe the root, he is no
                        longer speaking of the root itself, but of abstract concepts that he assigns to it. There is no
                        reason for the root, or anything else, to exist. No reason to emerge from random nothingness.
                        People describe and assign categories to things in an attempt to justify the existence of those
                        things. But, those things exist independently of any classification. Roquentin realizes that his{" "}
                        <i>Nausea</i> is from his attempts to assign meaning to the meaningless.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roquentin only moved to Bouville to enable his research on the Marquis de Rollebon. Now that he
                        no longer sees the purpose of that research, he has no reason to remain in town. After seeing
                        Anny, he plans to pack up his belongings, settle his debts, and move to Paris. As he sets off to
                        see Anny, he hopes that he can explain the <i>Nausea</i> to her so they can find some
                        commonality in the sensation. When he arrives at her hotel room, he finds it different than
                        expected. He always knew Anny to decorate the rooms of even short stays with art pieces and
                        artifacts from around the world that she had packed. However, the room is nearly bare. Anny
                        herself looked different as well. She had aged, gained weight, and she no longer had some of the
                        vigour that Roquentin had remembered her to have. Anny is pleased to see him, but not for his
                        company, she is still frustrated at his awkward conversation. She is pleased because she
                        believes that Roquentin is a static person: he never changes, a milestone. She can always
                        measure how much she has changed by using him as a reference. She called him here to get a sense
                        of how much she has changed over the past six years as he remained the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Roquentin disagrees with her assessment, especially due to his recent revelations on the nature
                        of his <i>Nausea</i>. He tries to explain, but she interrupts him. Her memory is precise and she
                        begins to recall exact moments in the past when Roquentin failed to do or say the right thing.
                        She explains her concept of "privileged situations" to him, specific scenes that have been
                        preordained to happen, like reference images in an old history book that was taken from her as a
                        child. In her mind, these situations must be turned into "perfect moments" by acting them out
                        just as they appear in her idealized world. This is why she was often frustrated with Roquentin,
                        but unable to explain why. He always said or did the wrong thing, ruining these potential
                        moments. This was also the reasoning for her starting, and later quitting, acting. She desired,
                        but was unable, to always control the realization of her ideal scenes. Roquentin is excited to
                        hear this, thinking that Anny has independently come to the same conclusion about <i>Nausea</i>{" "}
                        as he had. He describes his ideas about existence being independent form essence, but Anny
                        disagrees. To her, the existence of a moment in time is tied closely to its essence in her mind.
                        She asks him to leave and Roquentin, dissatisfied, obliges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After his trip to Paris, Roquentin returns to Bouville as he prepares to leave the town. Though
                        he is sure of his own existence, his wandering through the town still makes him feel alone in
                        it. Without his research on the Marquis, his self-awareness is the only thing keeping him from
                        the nothingness. Returning to his favorite Cafe, he requests that his favorite record be played
                        to help him say goodbye to the town. Listening to the music, Roquentin resolves to write once
                        again, not about the story of someone else, but of a story of his own design. Asserting his own
                        creation upon the world will justify his existence and allow his existence to persist even after
                        he is no longer alive. As the record plays once more, he once again gives his existence meaning
                        through his acts of creation.

                <>
                    Similar to Camus' <i>The Stranger</i>, I enjoyed the narrative vehicle that this work uses to convey
                    its philosophy. The two characters from Camus' and Satre's works: Meursault and Roquentin,
                    respectively, embody two different philosophies. Whereas Meursault confronts and accepts the
                    absurdity of his existence, Roquentin tries to push back against its implications. Both characters
                    realize that there is no inherent or external meaning for their existence. However, Roquentin makes
                    deliberate efforts to distance himself from the absurd, his <i>Nausea</i>. He tries to fill his time
                    with things that he thinks will themselves justify his existence: researching the Marquis,
                    travelling to Anny, or writing his own novel. Roquentin Believes that it is necessary for him to
                    bootstrap his own meaning to his life, he must pull himself out of the nothingness into the realm of
                    the meaningful. This is in contrast to Meursault, who fully embraces the absurd. He spends the final
                    moments of his story in revolt against the absurd, aiming to bring as much entropy to the world as
                    he is able. If there is no inherent order, chaos is therefore meaningless.
                    <p>
                        To me, Roquentin somewhat appears to be a man in denial. He acknowledges that there is no true
                        reason for his existence, that it is fundamentally random. However, he acts as if the meaning
                        that he creates for himself can serve as a faithful substitute for absolute meaning. During his
                        bouts of <i>Nausea</i>, he often observes those around him. Like the Self-Taught man, he too
                        only perceives them at a surface level, often describing background characters like one would
                        describe exhibits in a museum. To him, these people are no more animate than a rock or a tree
                        root, or even himself absent anything to justify his own existence. Each of these people have
                        their own reasons for justifying their own existence; if they are still random in Roquentin's
                        eyes, why would he be any different? It seems a folly to acknowledge the absurd, yet deny it
                        with attempts to create real meaning where none exists. Subjective illusions of meaning can
                        certainly be created, but the knowledge of the absurd must remain in the background. Without
                        this, one may live as if they had never confronted the absurd at all!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One detail that I found interesting came a the end of Roquentin's story. In the cafe, he
                        concludes that writing a novel will both allow him to explore himself and to allow his existence
                        to persist through his work, independent of himself. Just as he could preserve some portion of
                        the Msarquis' essence, so can a portion of himself be preserved through his own novel. This
                        reminds my of Hofstadter's reference strange loops. One mind may house another, albeit a
                        less-than faithful facsimile. Still, the host mind preserves some portion of the guest, almost
                        as if a portion of the guest has been duplicated or resurrected. A photo, video, novel, or piece
                        of music can achieve a similar effect, but at a much lower potency and a loop actively embedded
                        within another.
