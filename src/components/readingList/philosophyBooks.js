                <>
                    <u>The Stranger</u> is told from the perspective of Meursault, a French settler in Algiers, at the
                    time a part of France's colonial empire. The first part of the book opens with the death of
                    Meursault's mother and his travel to her old-age home and the subsequent funeral. Meursault's
                    general indifference and lack of grief during the process is our first introduction to his
                    character, including the fact that he is not sure what day she died on or even what her age was.
                    Throughout the evening vigil and the subsequent funeral, the narrator frequently references the
                    extreme heat of the North African environment. This induces stress and clouds his judgment, a fact
                    that will prove pivotal later on.
                    <p>
                        After the funeral, he returns to Algiers where he meets Marie, who previously worked as a
                        secretary at his company. After swimming and viewing a comedy film that day, they begin to form
                        a relationship, at least in Marie's eyes. Meursault enjoys the situation, but is apathetic
                        toward Marie's suggestions of formalizing their relationship. As Meursault is returning home
                        from work one day, he encounters Salamano, his elderly neighbor. Accompanying the old man is his
                        dog, which lost much of its formerly smooth coat due to mange. He notes his neighbor's
                        twice-daily ritual of taking the dog out as he curses and beats the animal for not behaving
                        properly.

                        Soon after, our protagonist becomes involved with Raymond Sintès, his neighbor and rumored pimp.
                        Raymond has convinced himself that his mistress, an Arab woman, has been unfaithful to him. To
                        this end, he employs Meursault to help him get his revenge. Over dinner, he asks the narrator to
                        write a letter which will trick the woman to return to him so he can execute his reprisal.
                        Despite the fact that Raymond had earlier proudly described his short temper and penchant for
                        violence, Meursault takes no issue with the moral implications of the situation; rather, he is
                        more interested in the fact that Raymond now describes him as his 'pal'. When the woman visits
                        Raymond's apartment, he beats her enough for the police to be called. When the officer arrives,
                        he gives Raymond a warning and a court notice. During the session, Meursault serves as a witness
                        of the woman's infidelity despite not observing any evidence for himself and law enforcement
                        takes no further action.

                    <p>
                        During this period, Meursault's boss at his firm extends an offer to travel to their new Paris
                        branch. He has no strong feelings about moving, going with whatever would seem to please his
                        superior; this draws his boss to criticize him for his lack of motivation. When Marie brings up
                        the topic of marriage, he reacts similarly. During another trip home from work, we meet Salamano
                        again. We learn that he has recently lost his dog. Despite his obvious ire for his pet, he is
                        extremely distraught. Meursault learns that Salamano adopted the dog shortly after his wife's
                        passing. Meursault notes his neighbor's contradictory behavior but does not offer any opinion to
                        the reader.

                        Soon after, Raymond invites Meursault and Marie to a weekend at his friend's bungalow on the
                        beach. On the way, the group encounters several Arab men who have recently been tailing Raymond;
                        one of these men is the brother of his former mistress. At the beach, Meursault, Raymond, and
                        his friend Masson encounter the group of Arabs again. This time, Raymond initiates a fight
                        during which he is badly slashed with a knife. During the scuffle, Raymond nearly draws his
                        revolver on his assailant, but is persuaded by Meursault to give him the weapon instead to
                        defuse the situation. The unnamed Arab men run off after this event.

                        Later in the day, Meursault goes on a walk on the beach alone, noting the extreme heat. On his
                        way to a natural spring that would relieve his suffering, he encounters the Arab man alone. As
                        the narrator approaches, the man draws the knife that he used to slash Raymond. Delirious from
                        heat exhaustion, Meursault shoots the man with Raymond's revolver. After a pause, he shoots him
                        four more times.

                        The second part of the book details the fallout of the unnamed man's murder. Meursault is
                        arrested and placed in prison awaiting trial. During his incarceration, he notes that it was
                        easier to accommodate to prison life than he imagined, due in part to his general detachment
                        from life in general. Over the next several months, he begins to talk to himself in his cell. At
                        several points, he is brought to the magistrate for evaluation. Meursault never denies the
                        murder, but also cannot fully articulate why he shot the man. During their meeting, Meursault's
                        apathy sends the magistrate into an impassioned and religious tirade; the narrator expresses his
                        confusion to the reader on how the subject is relevant to his case.

                    <p>
                        At the trial, the prosecution builds its case on Meursault's character and circumstances far
                        more heavily than the facts of the case. They point out how he did not cry at his mother's
                        funeral, how he went to see a comedy movie that same day, and even how he accepted coffee with
                        milk from the home's caretaker. Meursault is passionately described as a soulless monster for
                        his quietness and lack of empathy. The weight of these allegations thoroughly surprises
                        Meursault, who does not view himself as such. The defense calls several character witnesses on
                        his behalf, and his attorney assures Meursault that the sentence will likely be light if he is
                        found guilty.

                    <p>
                        As he awaits his execution, Meursault obsesses over the idea of a successful appeal and possible
                        ways of escape as he attempts to come to terms with his impending doom. He wonders how his death
                        can be at the behest of the nebulous notion of "the French people." After Meursault refuses the
                        prison chaplain several times, the chaplain visits his cell regardless. The chaplain preaches
                        that the narrator must come to terms with his actions to be forgiven by God and insists that
                        this is the only path forward. This pushes Meursault past his threshold, which has already been
                        worn thin. He shouts at the chaplain, something he has never done before. He does not believe in
                        God, nor does he seek to. In a rage, Meursault attacks the priest's philosophy and patronizing
                        attitude toward him. He asserts that there is no point in seeking God's forgiveness or hoping
                        for an appeal since he is condemned regardless—whether in a week by execution or in twenty years
                        by old age. Given this, none of his actions or desires matter since the outcome will always be
                        the same.

                    <p>
                        After prison guards separate the two, Meursault feels drained. He no longer has the energy to
                        hope for an appeal or a successful escape. He resigns himself to the "benign indifference of the
                        universe" and concludes that he is, and always has been, happy as he is absorbed into the
                        uncaring universe. He hopes that, at the date of his public execution, he will be surrounded not
                        by loved ones but by a large, hateful crowd.

                    The narrator, Meursault, serves as a vessel through which Camus explores a subset of 1940s French
                    society and the human condition more generally. A common theme that Camus includes in his story is
                    that the rules and customs of society are not based on any fundamental laws, but rather on vague
                    notions of morality and social convention. Serving as a detached observer, Meursault is a stranger
                    in this society, a feeling that Camus also imparts to the reader.
                    <p>
                        Several blatant absurdities and contradictions are present within the story. The police let
                        Raymond off with a warning after they determine that the woman he batters was unfaithful.
                        Salamano derides and abuses his dog, then experiences a great loss when it disappears. The
                        magistrate is convinced that Meursault can avoid harsh punishment if he repents, then quickly
                        unravels when Meursault does not reciprocate his conviction. The prosecutor builds his case
                        primarily on Meursault's minor behaviors that do not match societal expectations. The chaplain
                        insists that Meursault, a man condemned to a violent death, will be safe and at peace if he only
                        accepts that the Lord gives his life meaning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These incongruities compound until Meursault breaks. His already weak connection to society is
                        severed. He rejects the meanings and interpretations of life that are forced upon him, instead
                        asserting that no inherent meaning exists. From Camus's point of view, with Meursault as his
                        voice, the universe is fundamentally uncaring. There is no higher power or force setting
                        fundamental rules, be it society in general or a god. After Meursault accepts this, he feels at
                        peace. To him, the ultimate rejection of societal norms is to hope that his final moments are
                        spent surrounded by people who despise him.
                    </p>
                    <p>To many readers, this can be a rather attractive notion.</p>
