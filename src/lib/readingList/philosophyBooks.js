                <u>The Stranger</u> is told from the perspective of Meursault, a French settler in Algiers, at the time
                a part of France's colonial empire. The first part of the book opens with the death of Meursault's
                mother and his travel to her old-age home and the subsequent funeral. Meursault's general indifference
                and lack of grief during the process is our first introduction to his character, including the fact that
                he is not sure what day she died upon and even what her age was. Throughout the evening vigil and the
                subsequent funeral, the narrator frequently references the extreme heat of the North African
                environment. This induces stress and clouds his judgement, a fact that will prove to be pivotal later
                on.

                    After the funeral, he returns to Algiers where he meets Marie, who previously worked as a secretary
                    at his company. After swimming and viewing a comedy film that day, they begin to form a
                    relationship, at least in Marie's eyes. Meursault enjoys the situation, but is apathetic toward
                    Marie's suggestions of formalizing their relationship. As Meursault is returning home from work one
                    day, he encounters Salamano, his elderly neighbor. Accompanying the old man is his dog which lost
                    much of its formerly smooth coat dur to mange. He notes his neighbors twice-daily ritual of taking
                    his dog out as he curses and beats the animal for not behaving properly.

                    Soon after, our protagonist becomes involved with Raymond Sint√®s, his neighbor and rumored pimp.
                    Raymond has convinced himself that his mistress, an Arab woman, has been unfaithful to him. To this
                    end, he employs Meursault to help him get his revenge. Over dinner, he asks the narrator to write a
                    letter which will trick to woman to return to him so he can execute his reprisal. Despite the fact
                    that Raymond had earlier proudly described his short temper and pension for violence, Meursault
                    takes no issue with the moral implications of the situation, rather, he is more interested in the
                    fact that Raymond now describes him as his 'pal'. When the woman visits Raymond's apartment, he
                    beats her enough for the police to be called. When the officer arrives, he gives Raymond a warning
                    and a court notice. During the session, Meursault serves as a witness of the woman's infidelity
                    despite not observing any evidence for himself and law enforcement takes no further action.

                    During this period, Meursault's boss at his firm extends an offer to travel to their new Paris
                    branch. He has no strong feelings about moving, going with whatever would seem to please his
                    superior; this draws his boss to criticise him on his lack of motivation. When Marie brings up the
                    topic of marriage, he reacts similarly. During another trip home from work, we meet Salamano again.
                    We learn that he has recently lost his dog. Despite his obvious ire for his pet, he is extremely
                    distraught. Meursault learns that he adopted the dog shortly after his wife's passing. Meursault
                    takes note of his neighbor's contradictory behavior but does not offer any opinion to the reader.

                    Soon after, Raymond invites Meursault and Maria to a weekend at his friend's bungalow on the beach.
                    On the way, the group encounters several Arab men that have been recently been tailing Raymond; one
                    of these men is the brother of his former mistress. At the beach, Meursault, Raymond, and his friend
                    Masson encounter the group of Arabs again. This time, Raymond initiates a fight where he is badly
                    slashed with a knife. During the scuffle, Raymond nearly draws his revolver on his assailant, but is
                    persuaded by Meursault to give him the weapon instead to defuse the situation. The unnamed Arab men
                    run off after this event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later in the day, Meursault goes on a walk on the beach alone, noting the extreme heat of the day.
                    On his way to a natural spring that would relieve his suffering, he encounters the Arab man alone.
                    As the narrator approaches, the man draws the knife that he used to slash Raymond. Delirious from
                    heat exhaustion, Meursault accidentally shoots the man with Raymond's revolver. After a pause, he
                    shoots him four more times.

                    The second part of the book details the fallout of the unnamed man's murder. Meursault is arrested
                    and placed in prison awaiting trial. During his incarceration, he notes that it was easier to
                    accommodate to prison life than he imagined, due in part to his general detachment to life in
                    general. Over the next several months, he begins to talk to himself in his cell. At several points,
                    he is brought to the Magistrate for evaluation. Meursault never denies the murder, but also cannot
                    fully articulate why he shot the man. During their meeting, Meursault's apathy sends the magistrate
                    into an impassioned and religious tirade; the narrator expresses his confusion to the reader on how
                    the subject is relevant to his case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the trial, the prosecution builds its case on Meursault's character and circumstance far more
                    heavily than the facts of the case. They point out how he did not cry a his mother's funeral, how he
                    want to see a comedy movie that same day, and even how he accepted coffee with milk from the home's
                    caretaker. Meursault is described very passionately as a soulless monster for his quietness and lack
                    of empathy. The weight of these allegations thoroughly surprises Meursault who does not view himself
                    as such. The defense calls several character witnesses on his behalf and his attorney assures
                    Meursault that the sentence will likely be light if found guilty.
                </p>
                <p>Meursault is sentenced to execution by guillotine 'in the name of the French people'.</p>
                <p>
                    As he awaits his execution, Meursault obsesses over the idea of a successful appeal and possible
                    ways of escape as he attempts to come to terms with his impending doom. We wonders how his death can
                    be at the behest of the nebulous notion of 'the French people'. After refusing the prison chaplain
                    several times, he visits Meursault's cell regardless. The chaplain preaches that the narrator must
                    come to terms with his actions to be forgiven by God. He insists that this is the only path forward.
                    This pushes Meursault past his threshold, which has already been worn thin. He shouts at the
                    chaplain, something he has never been shown to do. He does not believe in God, nor does he care to.
                    In a rage, Meursault attacks the priest's philosophy and patronizing attitude towards him. He
                    asserts that there is no point in seeking God's forgiveness or hoping for his appeal since he is
                    condemned regardless, be it in a week by execution or in twenty years by old age. Given this, none
                    of his actions or desires even matter since the outcome will always be the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After prison guards separate the two, Meursault feels drained. He no longer has the energy to hope
                    for an appeal or a successful escape. He resigns himself to the 'benign indifference of the
                    universe' and concludes that he is, and always has been happy as he is absorbed into the uncaring
                    universe. He hopes that, at the date of his public execution, he will be surrounded not by loved
                    ones, but by a large and hateful crowd.

                The narrator, Meursault, serves as a vessel through which Camus explores a subset of 1940s French
                society, and human the human condition more generally. A common theme that Camus includes in his story
                is the fact that the rules and customs of society are not based on any fundamental laws, but rather on
                vague notions of morality and rule of law. Serving as a detached observer, Meursault is a stranger in
                this society that he is placed in, a feeling that Camus also imbues the reader with.
                <p>
                    Several blatant absurdities and contradictions are present within the story. The police let Raymond
                    off with a warning after they determine that the woman that he batters was unfaithful. Salamano
                    derides and abuses his dog, then experiences a great loss when it escapes. The magistrate is
                    convinced that Meursault can escape harsh punishment if he repents, then quickly unravels when
                    Meursault does not reciprocate his conviction. The prosecutor builds his case primarily upon
                    Meursault's minor behaviors that do not perfectly match the expectations of society. The chaplain
                    insists that Meursault, a man condemned to a violent death, will be safe and at peace if he only
                    accepts that the lord gives his life meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These incongruities compound upon themselves until Meursault breaks. His already weak connection to
                    society is severed. He rejects the meanings and interpretations of life that are forced upon him,
                    instead asserting that no inherent meaning exists. From the point of view of Camus, with Meursault
                    as his voice, the universe is a fundamentally uncaring place. There is no higher power or force
                    setting fundamental rules, be it society in general or a god. After Meursault accepts this, he feels
                    at peace. To him, the ultimate rejection of the norms of society would be to hope that his final
                    moments are spent surrounded by people who despise him.
                </p>
                <p>To many readers, this is can be a rather attractive notion.</p>
