                <u>QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter</u> is an adaptation of four lectures given by Richard
                Feynman at UCLA. Designed for readers without an in-depth knowledge in the field of{" "}
                <i>quantum electrodynamics</i>, the book is able to effectively convey the complex notions of the theory
                while remaining understandable to general audiences. Feynman uses analogies, diagrams, and his
                well-known <i>Feynman diagrams</i> to describe this subset of quantum field theory in terms that anyone
                can understand.

                This book served as my first (informal) introduction to QED, specifically, and even QFT in general. His
                analogies and examples, such as the connection he makes between photons reflecting off of a class
                surface and quantum non-determinism, help to frame the notoriously abstract concepts of the quantum
                realm in more familiar terms.
                <p>
                    I especially enjoy how the book is structured. It follows a clear progression from that high-level
                    example to the more complex reality of wave-particle dualities and virtual photons. I also found the
                    logic behind his Feynman diagrams interesting and how they can represent the infinite possibilities
                    of particle interactions within a series of simple lines.

                <u>Reality is Not What It Seems</u> is an exploration of the theory of <i>Loop Quantum Gravity</i> and
                of its millennia long origin story. Rovelli, a renowned theoretical physicist makes the decision to
                start this book, not with his own theory, but with the very origins of western scientific thought in
                pre-Socratic ancient Greece. Beginning with Anaximander and his assertions that the natural world is
                governed by discoverable laws rather than by personified gods, to Democritus and his atomic theory and
                the indivisibility of matter at its smallest levels.
                <p>
                    Leaping forward to the renaissance, the author highlights Galileo and his studies of how matter on
                    Earth moves and accelerates, along with Copernicus and Kepler and their calculations and laws on how
                    bodies move in the heavens. Onto Newton and his realization that the same laws that Galileo used to
                    describe objects on Earth could be used do describe the objects of the heavens just as Copernicus
                    and Kepler had done. His synthesis of these ideas went on the serve as the groundwork of physics
                    until the nineteenth century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Newton was able to describe how objects were influenced under gravity, his theories lacked
                    sufficient descriptions of electricity and magnetism. Realizing this, Faraday begins work on using
                    field lines to intuitively describe these forces. Made concrete with the equations of Maxwell, the
                    world was now able to model two of the yet-to-be-known four fundamental forces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the world seemingly close to a complete set of theories of the universe, in steps Einstein in
                    1905. Building on Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism and some intuitions from Galileo, he
                    realized two fundamental truths: the laws of physics were identical in any inertial reference frame
                    and that the speed of light in a vacuum was the same for any observer. These observations also
                    reveal something surprising that Newton's laws could not explain: the equivalence between energy and
                    matter. Ten year later, he goes on to further show that matter and energy can warp and distort
                    spacetime, incompatible with the flat environment assumed by Newtonian mechanics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step on the journey to <i>Loop Quantum Gravity</i> came a further ten years later with
                    rapid advances in quantum mechanics. Building on the quantization ideas of Plank at the turn of the
                    century, Bohr, Dirac, Schrodinger, and Heisenberg helped to paint a world that diverged further from
                    Newton's theories. Their equations described a world where matter has no well-defined position or
                    momentum, could disappear and reappear in a different location, could only hold certain masses and
                    energies, and could be in multiple places at once. After further evolutions in to quantum field
                    theory and the standard model, this is where the frontiers of physics have remained for nearly a
                    century.

                <p>
                    At this point, the work of Rovelli himself, along with his contemporaries emerges. They, however,
                    face a challenge. The smooth, continuous, and curved spacetime of general relativity seems
                    incompatible with the disjoint, discrete, and flat observations of quantum theory.{" "}
                    <i>Loop Quantum Gravity</i> is a theory designed to bridge this gap. Rovelli and colleagues assert
                    that space itself is quantized, defined by an enumerable, yet finite, amount of quantum loops and
                    spin networks. While this neatly solves many of the singularities within relativity and quantum
                    mechanics, it ha some alien implications. Chief among these is that the "arrow of time" that we
                    experience at a macroscopic level is merely an emergent construct, rather than a fundamental
                    attribute of the universe.

                Rovelli's work offers an in-depth and well-written explanation of both the current state of theoretical
                physics, from his point of view, and the long scientific journey tht was needed to arrive there. This
                also highlights several scientists and philosophers that are less widely known, but still serve as
                integral foundations to those who came after. Anaximander encouraged people to seek evidence-based
                explanations for phenomena instead of relying solely on superstition. Democritus gave rise to atomism
                and the indivisibility of matter at its smallest levels, which Einstein demonstrated through Brownian
                motion, and serves as the basis for Loop theory's quantization of spacetime. His approach helps to form
                a coherent narrative and give readers a clearer picture of how we evolved from understanding very little
                about natural phenomena to peering into the fundamental inner-workings of the universe.

                <u>The Little Book of String Theory</u> offers a short, accessible, and entertaining introduction to one
                of the most talked-about areas of physics today. String theory has been called the "theory of

                quantum mechanics in one unifying theory. But it is unproven and fraught with controversy. After reading

                Similarly to <u>QED</u>, this served as my first semi-serious introduction to <i>String Theory</i>.
                Gubser manages to fit an impressive amount of information into this relatively short book. From the
                strings themselves to D-branes, M-theory, and Supersymmetry, the book is able to convey the basic
                concepts behind these theories through the usage of diagrams and how they may help tp explain real-world
                phenomena.
                <p>
                    One of the most interesting portions for me was the last chapter of the book. Here, he explains how
                    the addition of a fifth dimension can help to explain the behavior of quark-gluon plasma after being
                    created by the collision of heavy gold nuclei. It stood out to me primarily because it was able to
                    take an observed phenomena that could already be described in terms of quantum field theory, and
                    re-frame it using string theory.

                <u>The Order of Time</u> explores the nature of time and its relationship to the universe. Within its
                pages, Rovelli argues that time is not a fundamental aspect of the universe, but rather an emergent
                consequence of the most basic properties of the universe. The book is broken into three parts: "The
                Crumbling of Time", "The World Without Time", and "The Sources of Time". The first part explores the
                most basic attributes of time and how, when you look closely at our best theories of the universe, they
                begin to break down. The second part explores how the most fundamental theories of the universe,
                especially quantum mechanics, do not require a privileged 'time' variable to function. The final part
                explores how our apparent experience of time emerges from a blurred perception of irreversible
                processes.

                Rovelli manages to cover an impressive amount of theory and conjecture within just over 200 pages. As a
                part of his discussion on the breakdown of <i>classical</i> time, the book explains how special
                relativity the lack of a universal ground-truth for time. He also describes one's <i>local time</i> as a
                member of a partially ordered set. In other words, the time experiences be two observers can only be
                compared after they causally interact with each other. Otherwise, such a measurement is meaningless. In
                the second part of the book, Rovelli describes how quantum interactions do not need to be governed by
                some local time value, rather they are only determined by other quantum events, the ordering of which is
                often asymmetric. This creates a sort of web of quantum events that evolve w.r.t. other events, rather
                than the passage of time.
                <p>
                    These ideas work to void the idea of a rigid <i>Block Universe</i> where the entire universe can be
                    resolved to a single state at every given instant. In such a universe all past states are both fully
                    resolved and static. To me, this idea seemed quite sensible until I read Rovelli's well-crafter
                    arguments as to why it does not fit with our current theories. The book also argues quite
                    convincingly in favor of <i>loop quantum gravity</i>, a theory which Rovelli himself is a pioneer
                    of. I have also noticed that the notions presented within this book seem (in a very rough sense)
                    compatible with Stephen Wolfram's conjectures on{" "}
